## Hi, I'm AJ! Welcome to my GitHub üëãüèΩ

I'm a front-end developer with a background in astrophysics and passion for art. I graduated with honors from the [Nucamp Full Stack Coding Bootcamp](https://www.nucamp.co/bootcamp-overview/full-stack-web-mobile-development) and am currently working as a Customer Engineer at an awesome startup called [Builder.io](https://builder.io)! Check out my project demos on my GitHub Pages [website](https://ancheetah.github.io).
